2)Which of these operators is not a comparison / logical operator?
=

3)What is true about the following code segment:
if  x == 5 :
    print('Is 5')
    print('Is Still 5')
    print('Third 5')

Depending on the value of x, either all three of the print statements will execute or none of the statements will execute

4)when you have multiple lines in an if block, how do you indicate the end of the if block?
You de-indent the next line past the if block to the same level of indent as the original if statement

5)You look at the following text:
if x == 6 :
    print('Is 6')
    print('Is Still 6')
    print('Third 6')

x = 0
if x < 2 :
    print('Small')
elif x < 10 :
    print('Medium')
else :
    print('LARGE')
print('All done')

8)For the following code, 
if x < 2 :
    print('Below 2')
elif x >= 2 :
     print('Two or more')
else :
    print('Something else')
		

This code will never print 'Something else' regardless of the value for 'x'

1

10)For the following code What will the value be for istr after this code executes
